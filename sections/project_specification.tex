\chapter{Project Specification}

Cuisenaire\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Rods \cite{TheCuise14:online} are an educational tool used in primary school mathematics classes to aid in the learning of, among other things, 'number bonds'. These are simple addition sums typically resulting in a round number like 10 or 20, such as $7+3=10$, which children learn as a foundation for more complex mathematical relationships. These are an important part of the Key Stage One (ages 5-7) curriculum in the UK, as recommended by the British Government \cite{Mathemat26:online}.

A set of rods consists of different-coloured cuboids, each of a different length, the smallest of which represents one unit. The rest of the rods are sized in multiples of this unit up to the longest rod, usually of size 10. Pupils are taught how different sized rods can be placed end-to-end in order to reach the target summation result, and are encouraged to find several alternate combinations of rods that add to the result, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:rods}. This is a physical representation of number bonds, as the pupil can learn to associate a 7-rod (a rod of length 7) and a 3-rod forming a line of length 10 units with the mathematical concept that $7+3=10$. \\

The current disadvantage of the use of these rods is that in a class of dozens of students, it can be difficult for a teacher to monitor and track student progress. The teacher can survey the classroom, but is not capable of giving every student constant attention, so inevitably, poor progress sometimes goes unnoticed and students may fall behind without extra support. Additionally, students need to make a record of the work they have done, which can be difficult with the existing rods, as their use does not necessarily involve any written work. The aim of this project is to design and build a product that resolves this, by using a technologically-enhanced version of the rods which will allow the teacher to detect struggling pupils and provide assistance to them, as well as keeping an electronic record of all the students' sessions with the rods. They should do so by gathering data about the way the students are using the enhanced rods, such as time spent on an exercise, how many answers were found, and perhaps even more complex information like detecting patterns in which solutions were discovered. This data can be analysed to provide an overview of how the entire class is coping with the task.\\

The project is split into two halves: the software, including processing of data and user interfaces, is being completed by another student (Pierre Azalbert). The hardware, including the design and production of the rods, is the focus of this report.\\


Making the correct design choices will greatly affect the efficacy of the product. The final product will likely be used by publicly-funded schools, so costs should be kept low. The aim of the product is to make the teaching process easier for the teacher and to improve the learning experience for the pupils, so care should be taken to make the product as accessible as possible for both parties. This means keeping setup steps simple for teachers, and using human-computer interface (HCI) principles to ensure students find the product easy to use.
