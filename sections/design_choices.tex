\chapter{Design Choices}
% Explain design decisions leading to final product

\section{Rod}
	% Rod type from interim
    % Conductive filament and why it can't be used + that's also why we cant have holes on all 4 sides
	% Why use ABS/other?
    
\section{Board}
	% Choice to 3D print and why not laser cutter
    % Why put lines on lid (affordance for kids and to stop cross-lane contact)
\section{Circuit}
	% Choice to use multiplexers + why that multiplexer
    % Finding input impedance of mux and how to choose resistor size
   	% Positioning of component to slot into lid
    % layers of stripboard
    % Choice to use stripboard and not PCB (flexibility in changes)

\section{Power}
	% Why portable/battery powered
    

\section{Board to Hub Communication}
	% nRF24L01 failure
    % HC05 success
    	% Talk about recommendations from internet forums as source
    % What data is sent and in what format and why
\section{Hub to Server Communication}
